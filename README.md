Not done, I may want to change the way the state and data persistance works. i tried something different and im not sure if im happy with it.

Big todos:
-basic styles
-(possibly) lift state to app.js, make fewer calls from there, passed as props
-more features
-possibly auth

Uses:

MongoDB

Express

React
